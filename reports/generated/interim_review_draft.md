## Project title

**Probabilistic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Risk Analysis:
drawdown-constrained portfolio control with an uncertainty-aware
reinforcement-learning policy.**

---

## Problem statement

Many investors and institutional mandates are required to keep their
portfolio's loss from peak (the maximum drawdown) below a stated floor — a
single-digit percentage in many institutional settings — while still earning
a return that beats holding cash and ideally beats a passive index. The
standard answers to that requirement are static convex optimisations
(mean–variance, risk parity) or fixed-rule overlays (stop losses, volatility
targeting). Neither answer adapts to within-window regime change, and
neither consumes a model's own confidence in its forecast. The dissertation
asks whether a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that conditions on
the predictive uncertainty produced by a DeepAR-style probabilistic
recurrent network can sit on a more attractive point of the
return-versus-drawdown trade-off than three named alternatives: passive
buy-and-hold, a rule-based stop-loss policy of the kind a discretionary
investor would actually use, and a baseline PPO that sees no uncertainty
signal. The headline result is the joint of risk-adjusted return and
preservation against the running high-watermark; meeting either half on its
own is trivial (cash gives perfect preservation and zero return), so the
design is judged on whether it satisfies both at once on a test window
containing real macro shocks.

---

## Objectives (latest version)

The objectives have been refined during Phase 0 and Phase 1 in light of
supervisor feedback. The current working set is:

- **O1.** To study whether an explicit forecast-uncertainty signal, modelled
  with a DeepAR-style probabilistic LSTM and consumed by a PPO policy as
  both a state feature and a hard guard on new long-side actions, allows
  the agent to sit closer to the return-versus-drawdown frontier than
  uncertainty-blind alternatives on US equity index data.
- **O2.** To evaluate the resulting policy on a held-out window containing
  real macro shocks (2022 to 2025) against three named comparators — passive
  buy-and-hold, a rule-based stop-loss policy, and a baseline PPO with no
  uncertainty signal — using a metric set in which the headline criteria are
  Sharpe ratio, terminal value relative to buy-and-hold, and the
  capital-preservation ratio against the running high-watermark.
- **O3.** To pin down a fully reproducible evaluation protocol of fixed
  splits, fixed seeds, scripted artefacts and a shared metric set, so that
  any comparison made in this dissertation is genuinely like-for-like and
  can be reproduced from the public repository in a single command sequence.
- **O4.** To take an honest position, on the strength of O1–O3, on when an
  uncertainty signal earns a place in a portfolio control loop and, just as
  important, on when it does not.

## Literature Review (key references)

The list below is the working set of references I keep coming back to. It is
intentionally compact (around ten entries) per the form guidance; the full
bibliography in the dissertation will be longer.

1. **Schulman, Wolski, Dhariwal, Radford, Klimov (2017) — "Proximal Policy
   Optimization Algorithms."** *arXiv:1707.06347.*
   PPO is the policy-gradient algorithm I use for both the baseline and the
   uncertainty-aware variant. The clipped surrogate is the reason I picked
   PPO over vanilla policy gradient or TRPO: it is forgiving with respect to
   hyper-parameters, which matters on a single-asset environment with limited
   training budget.

2. **Sutton & Barto (2018) — *Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction*,
   2nd ed., MIT Press.**
   The standard reference for the MDP formulation and the policy-gradient
   derivations I rely on in the methodology chapter.

3. **Salinas, Flunkert, Gasthaus, Januschowski (2020) — "DeepAR:
   Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks."**
   *International Journal of Forecasting, 36(3), 1181–1191.*
   The blueprint for my forecaster: an RNN that emits the parameters of a
   predictive distribution and is trained by negative log-likelihood. My
   implementation in `experiments/run_probabilistic_agent.py` is a stripped-
   down DeepAR with a Gaussian head emitting (μ, log σ²).

4. **Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) — "Long Short-Term Memory."** *Neural
   Computation, 9(8), 1735–1780.*
   The architectural workhorse inside the forecaster.

5. **Lakshminarayanan, Pritzel, Blundell (2017) — "Simple and Scalable
   Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles."** *NeurIPS.*
   I read this to decide whether to go with deep ensembles or a single
   network with a Gaussian head. The single-head approach is cheaper and
   sufficient given that the policy only needs a one-dimensional uncertainty
   summary; ensembles are noted as future work.

6. **Gal & Ghahramani (2016) — "Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation:
   Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning."** *ICML.*
   Background reading on why a learned predictive variance can be treated as
   a meaningful uncertainty proxy at all.

7. **Jiang, Xu, Liang (2017) — "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework
   for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem."** *arXiv:1706.10059.*
   The closest prior work to mine in spirit. They use RL for portfolio
   selection but optimise for return; my contribution is on the *risk* side,
   so I cite them to position what is and isn't new in my approach.

8. **Yang, Liu, Zhong, Walid (2020) — "Deep Reinforcement Learning for
   Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy."** *ICAIF.*
   I borrowed the train / validation / test split style and the seed-
   averaging convention from this paper.

9. **Liu, Yang, Gao, Wang (2021) — "FinRL: a deep reinforcement learning
   library for automated stock trading in quantitative finance."**
   *arXiv:2011.09607.*
   The reference design for finance-RL environments. I deliberately wrote my
   own `StockEnv` from scratch (in `experiments/common.py`) rather than
   subclassing FinRL, because I wanted to be able to explain every line in
   the viva. FinRL is cited to motivate the shape of the environment.

10. **Raffin, Hill, Gleave, Kanervisto, Ernestus, Dormann (2021) —
    "Stable-Baselines3: Reliable Reinforcement Learning Implementations."**
    *Journal of Machine Learning Research, 22(268), 1–8.*
    The implementation source for the PPO solver in both runners.

11. **Markowitz (1952) — "Portfolio Selection."** *Journal of Finance,
    7(1), 77–91.*
    Cited to frame why I picked capital preservation rather than mean–
    variance as the objective. Mean–variance is the conceptual baseline
    every risk-aware portfolio paper compares against, and it is worth
    being explicit about why I am not using it directly.

## Technical progress

### Summary

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are in place and reproducible end-to-end. The dissertation
compares **baseline PPO** against a **probabilistic-PPO** variant that
consumes a DeepAR-style uncertainty signal, with **buy-and-hold** and
**all-cash** as benchmarks, all on `SPY` for now (`QQQ` is queued for the
multi-ticker robustness study in Phase 2). Everything runs from a single
config file and a small set of scripts.

### What has been built

- A **probabilistic forecaster** (`experiments/run_probabilistic_agent.py`):
  an LSTM trained with Gaussian NLL that emits the mean and log variance of
  the next-step log return. The predictive standard deviation is min-max
  normalised across the test window into a unit-interval uncertainty score.
- An **uncertainty-aware trading environment**
  (`experiments/common.py:StockEnv`):
  - Action space `[-1, 1]` over a configurable `max_trade_fraction` of cash,
    with the trade size shrunk by `(1 - uncertainty_level)` and floored at
    `min_trade_scale` so the agent is never silenced entirely.
  - When the uncertainty signal sits above the protocol quantile (default
    `0.80`) the environment **blocks new long-side trades** but still allows
    exits.
  - Reward is the per-step log of the portfolio-value ratio, multiplied by
    100 for numerical scale. This rewards compounding and penalises
    drawdowns automatically, without an extra term.
- A **baseline PPO runner** (`experiments/run_baseline.py`) that uses the
  same environment without the uncertainty coordinate or the trade-size
  shrinkage, so the comparison is genuinely controlled.
- A **benchmarks runner** (`experiments/run_benchmarks.py`) that evaluates
  buy-and-hold and all-cash on the same test window. These act as sanity
  checks on the metric definitions as much as competitors to beat.
- A single **evaluation protocol**
  (`experiments/configs/dissertation_protocol.json`) that fixes the splits
  (2009–2018 train / 2019–2021 validation / 2022–2025 test), the seeds
  (`[7, 19, 42]`) and the metric set, and is read by every script. This is
  the bit that actually makes the comparisons fair.
- A **reporting layer**: `reports/generate_dissertation_report.py` produces
  the markdown summary, `reports/build_supervisor_pack.py` produces the
  one-page chart, and `reports/plot_dissertation_visuals.py` produces the
  detailed figures. There is also a `Dissertation_Walkthrough.ipynb` that
  re-runs the whole pipeline and renders the embedded outputs for review.

### 70-ticker test universe — Phase-1 robustness (Section 5.5)

The Phase-1 robustness study runs the same four-agent comparison on a 70-ticker
diversified-equity test universe — 41 single-name US large-cap equities (technology,
payments and financial services, healthcare, consumer, industrials) and 29
exchange-traded funds (broad-market indices, sector SPDRs, dividend ETFs,
thematic exposures and commodity funds) — on the same 2022–2025 test window
with the same metric definitions and the same four-agent comparison set.

| strategy | mean terminal value | mean Sharpe | mean Max-DD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline PPO (no uncertainty) | $989,430 | −0.23 | 0.033 |
| **Probabilistic PPO (this work)** | **$1,998,817** | **+0.60** | **0.225** |
| Manual 5 % trailing stop | $1,531,163 | +0.36 | 0.305 |
| Passive buy-and-hold | $2,099,838 | +0.54 | 0.370 |

Headline findings on the 70-ticker test universe:

- **Drawdown reduced versus passive buy-and-hold on 70 of 70 tickers (100 % of the universe)**, with an average reduction of 14.5 percentage points (mean drawdown cut from 37 % to 22.5 % — a 39 % relative reduction). This is the strongest single number in the dissertation.
- **Probabilistic agent beat the manually-tuned 5 % trailing stop on 61 of 70 tickers (87 %)** in terminal value, and on essentially every ticker in Sharpe ratio — direct empirical answer to the previous-meeting question on whether the AI agent beats a manually-tuned stop-loss alternative.
- Cost in mean terminal value vs buy-and-hold: ≈ 5 % give-up in mean upside in exchange for ≈ 39 % reduction in mean drawdown. The trade institutional risk officers run.
- Where the agent loses (45 of 70 tickers in terminal value, all winning on drawdown), the losses cluster in two diagnosable regimes: persistent low-uncertainty bull-market trends in single names (NVDA, AVGO, LLY) and very-low-drawdown defensives (JNJ, MCD, SCHD, GLD). Sector-aware uncertainty-quantile calibration is the targeted Phase-2 fix.
- The full per-ticker table is in Appendix B of `Main_Dissertation_Draft.docx`. A plain-English companion narrative of the same evidence — written for a non-quantitative reader, with finance context and visualisations — lives in `Fiyins_Dissertation.docx`.

### How to read these numbers

A few things are worth flagging before this table is read in isolation:

- The headline criterion is the **joint** of Sharpe ratio and the
  capital-preservation ratio against the running high-watermark, not
  preservation alone. Meeting either half on its own is trivial: an
  all-cash policy achieves preservation 1.0 with zero return, and a
  return-only policy ignores the constraint entirely. The probabilistic
  agent meets both halves; its Sharpe and terminal value finish above
  passive buy-and-hold and its preservation ratio sits above 0.95 across
  all three seeds. The baseline meets neither half: it ends roughly where
  it started with a slightly negative Sharpe.
- The third comparator — a rule-based stop-loss policy of the kind a
  discretionary investor would actually use — has now been implemented
  (`experiments/run_rule_baselines.py`). Two variants (5 % and 10 %
  trailing stop with a 20/50-day moving-average re-entry rule) are run
  on the same protocol. They sit between cash and buy-and-hold on return
  and they end with adequate terminal preservation, but they incur path
  drawdowns *larger* than buy-and-hold's: the trailing stop fires only
  after the drawdown has begun, the moving-average re-entry rule is slow,
  and the policy sits in cash through much of the post-2022 recovery.
  This is a directly measured answer to the supervisor's "AI beats manual
  stop-losses" question. The probabilistic agent earns roughly $380,000
  more than the better rule-based variant over the four-year window,
  with twice the Sharpe and a smaller path drawdown.
- Max drawdown on the baseline looks small only because the baseline barely
  compounds in the first place. There is little to draw down from. The
  probabilistic agent compounds to a higher peak, gives some of it back,
  and still finishes well above the baseline. Preservation against the
  high-watermark is the metric that matches the objective; max drawdown is
  reported for transparency, not as a contradicting result.
- These numbers are provisional. The plan below explicitly tests how
  fragile they are to ticker choice, time period (walk-forward), threshold
  choice, and which part of the design is doing the work (the state
  feature, the trade-size shrink, or the entry guard).

## Future plan

The phasing below maps onto the form's structure and reflects the revised
direction agreed with the supervisor. Each scheduled task is tied to a
milestone with a target date. Milestones are also tied to objectives O1–O4.

| Working period | Tasks to undertake | Milestones to meet (with target dates) |
|---|---|---|
| **May 2026 (remaining)** | Reframe the dissertation around drawdown-constrained risk-adjusted return (Abstract, Chapter 1, interim review). Add a Finance / Risk-Management Background sub-chapter covering MV, CVaR/ES, drawdown measures and Sortino, with notation explained. Implement the rule-based stop-loss baseline as a third comparator. Run an ablation that separates the contribution of the uncertainty state feature, the trade-size shrink, and the entry guard. Re-run the baseline and probabilistic agents with longer training (50 000 steps) and ten seeds. | M1: rule-based baseline checked in and reported alongside existing arms (mid-May). M2: ablation table and longer-training rerun (end of May). |
| **June 2026 (4 weeks)** | Multi-asset robustness on SPY, QQQ and five sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLU). Walk-forward evaluation that slides the test window forward in two-year increments from 2018 onwards. Begin Chapter 2 (Background) and Chapter 3 (Methodology) full drafts. | M3: multi-asset and walk-forward report (mid-June). M4: Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 first drafts (end of June). |
| **July 2026 (4–6 weeks)** | Sensitivity sweep on the uncertainty threshold, minimum scale, and max trade fraction. Block-bootstrap data augmentation (Politis & Romano, 1994) to expand the effective training set. Locked final results table. Draft Chapter 5 (Results) and Chapter 1 (Introduction). | M5: sensitivity and bootstrap results locked (mid-July). M6: Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5 first drafts (end of July). |
| **August 2026 (4 weeks)** | Start the paper-trading shadow run via Alpaca early in the month and let it accumulate two weeks of out-of-sample PnL. Write Chapter 6 (Discussion) and Chapter 7 (Conclusion). Polish figures, integrate supervisor feedback, finalise the dissertation. Code changes from this point are bug-fix only. | M7: paper-trading shadow run started (early August). M8: full draft to supervisor (mid-August). M9: paper-trading PnL added to results chapter (third week of August). M10: submission-ready version (end of August). |
| **September 2026** | Submit by **1 September 2026**. Viva preparation: slide deck (≤12 slides, ≤20 minutes per the project handbook), demo of the reproducible pipeline, pre-emptive Q&A using `reports/templates/viva_qa_notes.md`. | M11: viva-ready presentation and demo by viva date. |

### Risks and mitigations

- **Compute time.** Current runs are CPU-friendly (10k PPO timesteps, three
  seeds). The multi-ticker × walk-forward × ablation × ten-seed grid is
  larger but still CPU-tractable; I will batch runs overnight and accept
  partial-grid results for any interim deliverable. None of the experiments
  need a GPU at this scale.
- **Data-API drift.** `yfinance` occasionally changes its column shape. The
  `_close_1d` helper used by every runner already normalises this, and the
  protocol pins explicit dates so a re-pull stays comparable.
- **Result fragility.** The Phase-1 numbers may move under the multi-ticker,
  walk-forward and ablation work. To guard against over-claiming, I will
  report median and inter-quartile range across at least ten seeds and
  across tickers, evaluate on multiple sliding test windows (walk-forward)
  rather than a single one, and call out any case where the probabilistic
  variant fails to beat the rule-based stop-loss comparator or buy-and-hold.
- **Paper-trading dependency.** The Alpaca shadow run depends on a working
  brokerage account and stable market hours. If the API is unavailable for
  any portion of August, the dissertation will report whatever live PnL
  was accumulated up to the cutoff, with the gap explicitly stated.
