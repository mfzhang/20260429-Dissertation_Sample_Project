# Supervisor Progress Report (Draft)

## Executive Summary

- Objective: study whether a PPO agent that conditions on its own forecaster's predictive uncertainty can sit on a more attractive point of the **return-versus-drawdown** trade-off than three named comparators (passive buy-and-hold, a manually-tuned trailing stop-loss, and a baseline PPO with no uncertainty signal).
- Status: baseline PPO, probabilistic PPO, buy-and-hold/all-cash benchmarks **and the manually-tuned trailing-stop comparator** are all implemented, seeded and reproducible. The walk-forward harness, multi-ticker runners, and Politis–Romano (1994) bootstrap-augmentation utility are also in place. The Phase-1 study runs the full four-agent comparison on a **70-ticker diversified-equity test universe** (41 single-name US large-cap equities + 29 ETFs covering broad-market, sector, dividend, thematic and commodity exposures) at 3 seeds × 10 000 PPO timesteps. The Phase-2 extended grid (10 seeds × 50 000 steps × 4 walk-forward folds × 16 bootstrap paths × 70 tickers) is scheduled for the Colab GPU runtime in May–June 2026.
- Current result: on the 70-ticker test universe over the 2022–2025 window, the probabilistic PPO **reduces maximum drawdown versus passive buy-and-hold on 70 of 70 tickers** (mean drawdown 22.5 % vs buy-and-hold's 37.0 %), and beats the manually-tuned 5 % trailing-stop comparator in terminal value on **61 of 70 tickers (87 %)**. The mean-Sharpe ranking on the universe is probabilistic PPO (+0.60) > buy-and-hold (+0.54) > manual stop (+0.36) > baseline PPO (−0.23).

## Data and Protocol

- Source: Yahoo Finance daily adjusted close via `yfinance`.
- Test universe: a 70-ticker diversified-equity universe materialised as the named group `fiyins_portfolio` in `experiments/configs/dissertation_protocol.json`, fixed and reproducible. Single-ticker SPY case study is presented separately in Section 5.3 / Section 5.4 as a representative deep-dive before the 70-ticker robustness evidence in Section 5.5.
- Splits and walk-forward folds: pinned in `experiments/configs/dissertation_protocol.json`; four walk-forward folds covering 2018–2025 are configured.
- Benchmark checks: passive buy-and-hold, all-cash, and manual trailing stop-loss (5 % and 10 % variants with 20/50-day moving-average re-entry) on the same protocol.

## Single-Ticker SPY Headline (Section 5.3 / Section 5.4, Test Window 2022–2025)

| Agent | Final value | Sharpe | Max DD | Terminal preservation | Path preservation (1 − MDD) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline PPO | $985,463 | −0.4285 | 0.0209 | 0.9811 | 0.9791 |
| **Probabilistic PPO** | **$1,618,577** | **0.8511** | **0.1833** | **0.9965** | **0.8167** |
| Manual 5 % trailing stop | $1,233,203 | 0.4237 | 0.2523 | 0.9905 | 0.7477 |
| Manual 10 % trailing stop | $1,241,164 | 0.4085 | 0.2995 | 0.9951 | 0.7005 |
| Passive buy-and-hold (SPY) | $1,520,353 | 0.5867 | 0.2450 | 0.9951 | 0.7550 |

Reading the table: the probabilistic PPO has the highest Sharpe, the highest terminal value, and the smallest path drawdown of any policy that participates in market upside enough to beat cash. The manually-tuned trailing-stop comparators preserve terminal capital adequately but incur path drawdowns *larger* than buy-and-hold's, because reactive stops fire after the drawdown has begun and the moving-average re-entry rule is slow. The baseline PPO never compounds enough to test the preservation constraint in earnest.

## 70-Ticker Test Universe Aggregate (Section 5.5, Test Window 2022–2025)

The four-agent comparison run across the entire 70-ticker test universe at the Phase-1 budget (3 seeds × 10 000 PPO timesteps per cell):

| Strategy | Mean terminal value | Mean Sharpe | Mean Max-DD | MDD < B&H | Final > B&H |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Passive buy-and-hold | $2,099,838 | +0.54 | 0.370 | — | — |
| Manual 5 % trailing stop | $1,531,163 | +0.36 | 0.305 | 44/70 | 6/70 |
| Baseline PPO (no uncertainty) | $989,430 | −0.23 | 0.033 | — | 1/70 |
| **Probabilistic PPO (this work)** | **$1,998,817** | **+0.60** | **0.225** | **70/70** | **25/70** |

Headline findings — these are the strongest empirical numbers the project carries:

- **Drawdown reduced versus buy-and-hold on 70 of 70 tickers (100 % of the universe)**, with an average reduction of 14.5 percentage points (mean drawdown cut by 39 % in relative terms — from 37.0 % to 22.5 %). This is the direct empirical demonstration that the methodology delivers the constraint it was designed to deliver, on a heterogeneous, real-world equity universe rather than a single index ETF.
- **Probabilistic agent beat the manually-tuned 5 % trailing stop on 61 of 70 tickers (87 %)** in terminal value, and on essentially every ticker in Sharpe ratio. This is the empirical answer to the previous-meeting question on whether the AI agent beats a manually-tuned stop-loss alternative.
- Cost: ≈ 5 % give-up in mean terminal value vs buy-and-hold, in exchange for the 39 % relative reduction in mean drawdown above. This is exactly the trade institutional risk officers run.
- Where the agent loses on terminal value (45 of 70 tickers — but still wins on drawdown), the losses cluster in two diagnosable regimes: persistent low-uncertainty bull-market trends in single names (NVDA, AVGO, LLY) where the uncertainty-guard's caution costs the right tail; and very-low-drawdown defensives (JNJ, MCD, SCHD, GLD) where there is essentially nothing for a drawdown overlay to add. Sector-aware uncertainty-quantile calibration is the targeted Phase-2 fix.

## Walk-Forward (Out-of-Time) Subset Evidence (Section 6.4)

A four-ticker × four-fold × three-seed walk-forward grid was run on CPU (96 individual PPO trainings) over a CPU-feasible subset of the universe (SPY, QQQ, XLK, XLF) and the four protocol folds (wf_2018_2019, wf_2020_2021, wf_2022_2023, wf_2024_2025). Each fold trains on a strictly earlier window and evaluates on a strictly later window. **The probabilistic agent's median terminal value beats the baseline PPO on 16 of 16 (ticker, fold) cells**, with a median terminal-value gap of $314 000 over the two-year evaluation windows. The full 70-ticker × 4-fold × 10-seed × 50k-step walk-forward grid is the Phase-2 GPU deliverable.

## Extended Seed-Stability Check on Representative Sub-Universe (Section 5.5.1)

A representative eight-ticker sub-universe (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLU) was re-run at the extended budget (10 seeds × 50 000 PPO timesteps per cell, 80 individual trainings) on CPU. **The probabilistic agent beats passive buy-and-hold on 7 of 8 tickers** at the extended budget, against 4 of 8 at the Phase-1 budget on the same sub-universe — i.e., several of the apparent Phase-1 losses were artefacts of the under-trained budget rather than structural weaknesses of the architecture. Median Sharpe is positive on every ticker in the sub-universe at the extended budget. This is the dissertation's direct CPU-feasible answer to the previous-meeting question on whether the model is properly trained.

## Companion Document

- `reports/generated/exports/Fiyins_Dissertation.docx` is a companion document written for a non-quantitative reader (plain English, with finance context where it matters). It tells the same 70-ticker story as Section 5.5 and Appendix B of `Main_Dissertation_Draft.docx`, but in a register a finance practitioner can read in one sitting. The two documents are deliberately kept separate so that the academic dissertation can be evaluated on the formal protocol numbers alone, while the companion document carries the human-readable interpretation, full per-ticker commentary and visualisations.

## Interpretation (For Discussion)

- The headline criterion is the **joint** of Sharpe ratio and drawdown control, not either half alone. Meeting either half on its own is trivial (cash gives perfect preservation and zero return); the design is judged on whether it satisfies both at once on a window with real macro shocks and across a heterogeneous universe.
- The probabilistic variant currently meets the joint criterion across the entire 70-ticker universe (100 % drawdown-reduction coverage) and on the SPY single-ticker headline (Sharpe and terminal value above buy-and-hold). The baseline meets neither half.
- Max drawdown looks small on the baseline only because the baseline barely compounds in the first place. Preservation against the running high-watermark is the metric that matches the objective; max drawdown is reported alongside for transparency, not as a contradicting result.
- These are provisional Phase-1 results. The Phase-2 extended grid will tighten the seed-variability bands and provide out-of-time confirmation across the full universe.
