        "A risk-constrained investor — a pension fund, a CTA hedge fund, a family office, "
        "or a behaviourally loss-averse retail account — has to satisfy two requirements at "
        "once: not lose more than a stated percentage from peak, and earn a return above "
        "cash. Mean-variance optimisation cannot solve this jointly because it is single-"
        "period and blind to path-dependent loss. Trailing stop-losses fire after the "
        "drawdown has already happened and forfeit the recovery. Risk parity targets "
        "volatility rather than drawdown. The gap is real, the mandates that create it are "
        "billions of pounds under management, and the literature on how a sequential "
        "decision policy might fill that gap is thin. This dissertation studies one "
        "candidate. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is paired with a DeepAR-"
        "style probabilistic long short-term memory network that emits a Gaussian over the "
        "next-step log return; the predictive standard deviation is normalised to a unit-"
        "interval uncertainty score and is fed both into the PPO policy state and into a "
        "hard guard on new long-side actions. The combined system is evaluated against "
        "three named comparators on a single fully reproducible protocol: passive buy-and-"
        "hold, a rule-based trailing stop-loss policy of the kind a discretionary investor "
        "would actually use, and a baseline PPO that sees no uncertainty signal. Fixed "
        "train, validation and test splits over US equity index data (2009 to 2025), three "
        "random seeds in the headline study and a metric set covering Sharpe ratio, "
        "maximum drawdown, the 95 % Value-at-Risk violation rate, and both terminal and "
        "path versions of the capital-preservation ratio. On the held-out 2022–2025 test "
        "window the probabilistic agent has the highest Sharpe (0.85), the highest "
        "terminal value, and the smallest path drawdown of any policy that participates in "
        "market upside enough to beat cash. Crucially, the rule-based stop-losses end with "
        "adequate terminal preservation but incur path drawdowns larger than buy-and-hold's: "
        "reactive stops fire late and the moving-average re-entry sits in cash through "
        "much of the recovery. The contribution claimed is deliberately modest — a "
        "careful empirical study of a specific combination on a reproducible protocol with "
        "the rule-based comparator that the DRL-finance literature mostly leaves out, not "
        "a new algorithm. The Phase-1 study runs the full four-agent comparison on a 70-"
        "ticker diversified-equity test universe (41 single names + 29 ETFs) at three seeds "

        "Institutions think about something different: drawdown. Imagine you start with "
        "$100. The price goes up to $150 (a new peak). Then it drops to $120. Your "
        "drawdown is measured against the $150 peak, not the $100 starting balance — you "
        "are 20 % down from the high. The reason this matters more than volatility, in "
        "practice, is that you don't feel a wiggle; you feel the pain of looking at your "
        "account and seeing it well below where it has just been. If you manage a "

        "covariance structure of returns is the binding determinant of portfolio risk, "
        "not the volatility of the constituent assets in isolation, and a portfolio "
        "manager should optimise the joint of return and variance rather than each in "

        "qualitative discipline into a quantitative one.",
    )
    add_bullets(doc, [
        "Advantages. The optimisation is a convex quadratic programme that is solved exactly in milliseconds, the efficient frontier admits a closed-form parametric description in the unconstrained case, and the framework gives a single-number ranking (Sharpe ratio) that has become the default communication of risk-adjusted performance. It is the foundation of every academic and industrial extension of portfolio theory.",
        "Disadvantages. The framework assumes the joint return distribution is stationary with known mu and Sigma, but in practice both have to be estimated on a finite training window. The resulting weights are notoriously sensitive to estimation error: small changes in mu can produce large rebalancings in w, a phenomenon Michaud (1989) labelled \"error-maximising\" portfolios. The variance objective penalises upside and downside deviations symmetrically, which is conceptually wrong for a long-only mandate where upside volatility is desirable. And by being single-period the framework ignores path-dependent properties of the equity curve such as drawdowns, which are the constraint that institutional mandates actually bind on.",
        "Fixes / extensions in the literature. Black and Litterman (1992) reduce estimation error by shrinking mu towards an equilibrium prior derived from the market portfolio. Ledoit and Wolf (2003) shrink Sigma towards a structured target. The downside-only measures of Section 2.1.4 (Sortino) replace symmetric variance with downside deviation. The tail-loss measures of Section 2.1.2 (VaR / ES) replace variance entirely with a tail quantile. The drawdown measures of Section 2.1.3 (MDD / Calmar / CDaR) replace single-period variance with a path-dependent loss-from-peak. This dissertation positions itself in the last family, with the additional move of using a sequential reinforcement-learning policy rather than a one-shot static optimisation.",
        "Why it matters here. Mean-variance is reported in Chapter 5 alongside the path-dependent metrics so the reader can apply whichever objective matches their mandate. It is not the dissertation's headline objective because, on a 70-ticker test universe over a four-year window with a 2022 macro shock, path-dependent drawdown is what binds; a mean-variance optimiser sees no difference between a -25 % path drawdown that recovers and a smooth -5 % linear loss with the same variance.",

They will rate identically a smooth -10 % loss in a single step and a -25 % drawdown that recovers to a -10 % loss by the rebalancing date, even though the second is the one that breaks pension-fund mandates and triggers margin calls. Estimation of the tail itself is also data-hungry: at alpha = 0.99 the tail contains 1 % of the data, so even ten years of daily returns gives only ~25 observations on which to estimate the conditional expectation.",
        "Fixes / extensions in the literature. Acerbi and Tasche (2002) clarified that ES is the smallest coherent risk measure that dominates VaR. The drawdown measures of Section 2.1.3 (MDD, Calmar, CDaR) are the path-dependent generalisation that closes the single-period gap. For tail-estimation small-sample issues, extreme value theory (McNeil and Frey, 2000) replaces the empirical tail with a fitted Generalised Pareto Distribution, trading estimation efficiency for a parametric assumption.",

The MDD itself is also a single-event statistic — it depends only on the worst peak-to-trough excursion in the path, so the rest of the distribution of drawdowns is discarded, and a small change in input data can produce a large change in MDD.",

The 100 % ticker-coverage of the drawdown-reduction result is the strongest single number in the dissertation and the direct empirical answer to the question of whether the methodology delivers the constraint it was designed to deliver.",

This is exactly the trade institutional risk officers, endowment managers and hedge-fund risk committees are asked to make every quarter (Markowitz 1952; Chekhlov, Uryasev and Zabarankin 2005). A {rel_dd_reduction:.0f} % cut in mean drawdown for a sub-{terminal_giveup_pct:.0f} % give-up in mean terminal value is, by any of those frameworks, an attractive contract.",

This is the empirical answer to the supervisor's challenge that an AI agent's advantage over a manual stop-loss rule must be measured rather than asserted: on the diversified equity universe, in 87 % of cases, the probabilistic agent strictly outperforms the textbook trailing stop in terminal value.",
